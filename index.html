	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I received my BA from The New School for Public Engagement with the focus on Media and Culture.
	Before attending High school and University in the United States, I grew up in Munich, Germany and Oxford, England speaking both German and English with native fluency. 
	Attending International Schools and living in different continents has helped me become a strong communicator as I was continuously forced to adapt to many different situations.
	I am a quick learner who can rapidly adapt to changing situations, while utilizing my knowledge.
	On my spare time I enjoy walking my dog, spending time exploring new areas. If its not hiking, you can find me on a sailboat.</p>
